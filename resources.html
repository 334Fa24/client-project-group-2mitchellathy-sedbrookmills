          <h3> Question 1:  What services do you offer?</h3>
          <p>  Answer 1: We offer a range of grooming services, including baths, haircuts, nail trims, ear

                cleaning, teeth brushing, de-shedding treatments, flea and tick treatments, and more. We also

                have special packages like puppy grooming and deluxe spa options for pampering your pet!</p>
            
          <h3>Question 2: How often should a dog be groomed? </h3>
          <p>Answer 2: The frequency of grooming depends on your dog's breed, coat type, and lifestyle. Dogs

                    with long or curly coats often need grooming every 4-6 weeks, while short-haired breeds may

                    only need a bath and nail trim every 8-12 weeks. Regular grooming keeps your dog healthy,

                    comfortable, and looking great. </p>
            
            <h3>Question 3:  How long does a grooming session take? </h3>
          <p>Answer 3: A typical grooming session lasts between 2 to 3 hours, depending on the size of your

                    dog, the condition of their coat, and the services selected. For more complex services like de-

                    shedding or specific breed cuts, it might take longer. We always strive to provide efficient

                    service while ensuring your dog feels comfortable and relaxed.

          <h3>Grooming and Coat Care</h3>
            <p>1.Brush your dog's coat regularly, ideally a few times a week, to prevent matting and reduce shedding.</p>
            <p>2. Bathe your dog every 4-8 weeks, depending on their coat type and lifestyle. Over-bathingcan dry out their skin.</p>
            <p>3.Use dog-specific shampoos and conditioners. Human products can irritate your pet's skin.</p>
            <p>4. Trim your dog's nails every 3-4 weeks, or when you hear them clicking on the floor.</p>
            <p>5. Clean your dog's ears weekly with a veterinarian-approved solution to prevent infections.</p>
            <p>6. Brush your dog's teeth daily if possible, or at least 2-3 times a week, to maintain good oral health.</p>
